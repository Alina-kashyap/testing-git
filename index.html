    <p style=width:50%>Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many
    different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different
    from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and
    strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences
    between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting
    coffee.</p>

    <p style= width:50%>As coffee roasts get "darker", the color of the coffee beans darkens and more coffee oils appear on the surface. In keeping with these characteristics, French roast coffee beans are dark brown and shimmering with oil.French roast beans are also at the end of what's called the "second crack." This means they are cooked with such intensity that they make two cracking noises during the roasting</p>

    <!--paragraph of colombian coffee-->
    <p style=width:50%>Colombian coffee is coffee that is grown in Colombia. Colombian coffee tends to demand a higher price because it is
    mostly made up of the superior arabica variety. Colombian coffees can have heavy notes of chocolate and nuts, or lighter
    fruit and floral notes, depending on which department it’s grown.</p>
